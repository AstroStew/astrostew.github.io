## Figuring Out Where I should live...
After living in Toronto for 4 years to complete my undergrad in Space Engineering at York University I have grown to hate the city. Now, I might be moving back to Toronto to finish classes related to my Masters (even tho classes always seem to transition online after a couple months of in-person classes because of COVID-19). Faced with this possibility I wanted to make my experience as enjoyable as possible. Taking data from the city of Toronto website and trying out geopandas for the first time I was able to make some assertions about where not to live.

The following is a condlusion of the results:
- **Avoid:** Moss Park and Chruch-Yonge Neighborhoods have some of the worst crimes rates and have increasing crime rates!
- **Avoid:** Bridle Path Sunnybrook-York Mills and neighbouring areas have the hgihest home prices!
- **Consider:**  Forest Hill South,Pleasant View and Bedford Park-Nortown have the lowest Assault Rate of 2021!
- **Consider:** Downsview-Roding-CFB and Englemont-Lawrence have the highest number of apartments making it easily to find one!
