February 03 2023.

I had figured that it was time that I officially joined the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) with all the fancy Photometry and Astronometry work that I was conducting as part of my research.
To kick off joining, I decided to present my work on Photometric Transformations (Absolute and Differential) with Python.

The full transcript of the RASC Meeting can be found by clicking the folloiwng link:

It is in my hopes that I will continue to work with the RASC Ottawa team to promote open-source collaboration and to educate younger generations on astronomy.
